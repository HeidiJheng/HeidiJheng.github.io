Great news for the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek-Vlaanderen (FWO)â€”National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (NSTC) two-year mobility project grant awarded to the Belgium (PI: Prof. David Gijbels, Co-PI: Prof. Karolien Poels) and Taiwan research team (PI: Prof. Hsiu-Ping Yueh, Co-PI: Prof. Szu-Hsien (Tony) Lee, Prof. Weijane Lin). I'm very glad to be participating in this exchange research visit as a junior researcher. Looking forward to exploring cross-cultural studies : )
