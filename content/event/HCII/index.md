abstract: The objective of this study is to design and evaluate an Emotional Karaoke Robot system (EKR) which improves user experience. An exploratory study was conducted to discover the changes of participants’ emotion toward the EKR system during the experiment. 16 Chinese participants who had been to karaoke TV in the past 6 months were invited to use the EKR system. Four interactive conditions (simple interaction task, diverse neutral emotional interaction task, diverse positive emotional interaction task, diverse negative emotional interaction task) with a within-subject design were conducted. The results indicated that participants’ emotional reaction were enhanced a lot during the study. The average level of arousal, hedonic value, and user satisfaction under diverse positive/negative emotional interaction condition is greater than under the neutral one. Participants in diverse positive/negative emotional interaction task felt more positive than in diverse neutral emotional interaction task. Emotional Karaoke Robot system successfully elicited participants’ emotion and improved users’ experience.
