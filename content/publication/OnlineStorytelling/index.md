abstract: The present study used a mixed methods approach to investigate effective online storytelling strategies in agricultural product marketing. Interviews were conducted with three marketing directors from agricultural e-commerce platforms, and content analysis of agricultural narratives was performed. Additionally, survey data was collected to understand consumer attitudes toward storytelling in agricultural marketing. The findings revealed that the marketing directors emphasized brand value proposition and product quality when formulating marketing strategies, which were consistent with consumer perspectives. Moreover, the study identified various elements in agricultural narratives in regard to characters, conflicts, events, and messages. This study contributes to the existing literature and offers practical insights for online agricultural marketing.
